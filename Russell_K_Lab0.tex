\maketitle

1. Last summer I participated in an internship with Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories.  I was a Reliability Engineering Intern in the Quality Department.


2. I have no experience with Python coming into the lab, so I would like to come out of this lab being familiar with python and it's usefulness to Electrical Engineers.  Additionally, latex is somewhat familiar to me, so I am looking forward to solidifying what I already know about Latex.
